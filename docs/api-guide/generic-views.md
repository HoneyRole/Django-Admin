# Generic views

> Djangoâ€™s generic views... were developed as a shortcut for common usage patterns... They take certain common idioms and patterns found in view development and abstract them so that you can quickly write common views of data without having to repeat yourself.

> &mdash; [Django Documentation][cite]

One of the key benefits of class based views is the way they allow you to compose bits of reusable behaviour.  REST framework takes advantage of this by providing a number of pre-built views that provide for commonly used patterns.

# Base views

## BaseAPIView

Extends REST framework's `APIView` class, adding support for serialization of model instances and model querysets.

## MultipleObjectBaseAPIView

Provides a base view for acting on a single object, by combining REST framework's `APIView`, and Django's [MultipleObjectMixin].

**See also:** ccbv.co.uk documentation for [MultipleObjectMixin][multiple-object-mixin-classy].

## SingleObjectBaseAPIView

Provides a base view for acting on a single object, by combining REST framework's `APIView`, and Django's [SingleObjectMixin].

**See also:** ccbv.co.uk documentation for [SingleObjectMixin][single-object-mixin-classy].

## ListModelMixin

Provides a `.list(request, *args, **kwargs)` method, that implements listing a queryset.

## CreateModelMixin

Provides a `.create(request, *args, **kwargs)` method, that implements creating and saving a new model instance.

## RetrieveModelMixin

Provides a `.retrieve(request, *args, **kwargs)` method, that implements returning an existing model instance in a response.

## UpdateModelMixin

Provides a `.update(request, *args, **kwargs)` method, that implements updating and saving an existing model instance.

## DestroyModelMixin

Provides a `.destroy(request, *args, **kwargs)` method, that implements deletion of an existing model instance.

## MetadataMixin

Provides a `.metadata(request, *args, **kwargs)` method, that returns a response containing metadata about the view.
