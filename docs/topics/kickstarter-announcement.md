In order to continue to drive the project forward, I'm launching a Kickstarter campaign to help fund the development of a major new release - Django REST framework 3.

## Project details

This new release will allow us to comprehensively address some of the shortcomings of the framework, and will aim to include the following:

* Faster, simpler and easier-to-use serializers.
* An alternative admin-style interface for the browsable API.
* Search and filtering controls made accessible in the browsable API.
* Alternative API pagination styles.
* Documentation around API versioning.
* Triage of outstanding tickets.
* Improving the ongoing quality and maintainability of the project.

Full details are available now on the [project page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tomchristie/django-rest-framework-3).

If you're interested in helping make sustainable open source development a reality please [visit the Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tomchristie/django-rest-framework-3) and consider funding the project.

I can't wait to see where this takes us!

Many thanks to everyone for your support so far,

  Tom Christie :)

## Sponsors

We've now blazed way past all our goals, with a staggering Â£30,000 (~$50,000), meaning I'll be in a position to work on the project significantly beyond what we'd originally planned for. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to all the wonderful companies and individuals who have been backing the project so generously, and making this possible.
