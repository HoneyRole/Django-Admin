# Funding

If you use REST framework commercially we strongly encourage you to invest in its continued development by signing up for a paid plan.

**We believe that collaboratively funded software can offer outstanding returns on investment, by allowing users and clients to collectively share the cost of development.**

Signing up for a paid plan will:

* Directly contribute to faster releases, more features and higher quality software.
* Allow more time to be invested in documentation, issue triage and community support.
* Safeguard the future development of REST framework.

REST framework will always be open source and permissively licensed, but we firmly believe it is in the commercial best-interest for users of the project to fund its ongoing development.

## Making the business case

Our successful Kickstarter campaign demonstrates the cost-reward ratio of shared development funding.

With *typical corporate fundings of just £100-£1000 per organization* we successfully delivered:

* The comprehensive 3.0 serializer redesign.
* Pagination API including new offset/limit and cursor pagination implementations, plus  on-page controls.
* The versioning API, including URL based and header based versioning schemes.
* Customizable exception handling.
* The metadata APIs for handling `OPTIONS` requests.
* Templated HTML form support, including HTML forms with nested list and objects.
* Internationalization support for API responses, currently with 27 languages.
* Improvements to the browsable API.
* The admin interface.
* Support for Django's PostgreSQL HStoreField, ArrayField and JSONField.
* Ongoing triage and community support, closing over 1600 tickets.

This incredible level of return on investment is *only possible through collaboratively funded models*, which is why we believe that supporting our paid plans is in everyone's best interest.

## Individual plan

This subscription is recommended for freelancers and other individuals with an interest in seeing REST framework continue to&nbsp;improve.

If you are using REST framework as an full-time employee, consider recommending that your company takes out a [corporate&nbsp;plan](#corporate-plans).

## Roadmap

The roadmap below is a broad indication of just some of the ongoing and future work we believe is important to REST framework.

* Support for alternative backends such as SQLAlchemy.
* HTTP Caching API & support for conditional database lookups.
* Performance improvements.
* Improved project documentation, including versioned & internationalized docs.
* Hypermedia support and client libraries.
* API metric tools.
* Debug & logging tools.
* In depth documentation on advanced usage and best practices.
* Third party GraphQL support.
* Documentation & support for integration with realtime systems.
* Improved third party package visibility.
* Increasing our "bus factor" through documented organizational process & safeguards.
* Continuing triage & community support.

By taking out a paid plan you'll be directly contributing towards making these features happen.
